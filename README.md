* This is a source code of encryption and decryption based on "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution algorithm refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.
* This algorithm fixes the defect of Shannon's one bit one secret algorithm.
* A password can be used infinitely without changing.

* It's just a demo version, with the official, enhanced and final versions.
* If you need source code, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack it one day in my lifetime.
