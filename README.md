* This is a source code of encryption and decryption based on "JunTai"(like Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, its value appears only once without repetition
* This algorithm fixes the defect of Shannon's one time one secret algorithm.
* A password can be used infinitely without changing.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes lower version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!

* Compiled on MacOS, Linux and *BSD in X86_64 platform.
